  <h1>Non-Fiction Writing</h1>
  <h2><a href="PDFs/BloodFLows.pdf">Blood Flows</a></h2>
  <blockquote><p>I hung the script on my fridge on June 26th, and it’s been hanging there ever since. Each time I pass the fridge, reach in to get the creamer for my morning coffee, or take out my insulin so I can change my infusion set, it stares back at me. The script hangs there with a few check marks on the page, asking for my vitals, my hemoglobin A1c, how my thyroid glands are working. I glare back at it; I know that at some point, I’ll take that stupid script down to Quest to give a urine sample and multiple vials of blood. But until then, I keep up this staring contest with that thin piece of paper and try to deny that my health isn’t in perfect condition. I thought I’d gotten past that point. Apparently not.</p></blockquote>
  <h2><a href="PDFs/DragWars.pdf">To Mimi Imfurst, Thanks for…Something!: A Night at Philadelphia’s Drag Wars</a></h2>
  <blockquote><p>“Come on, Auschwitz, get up here!” Mimi Imfurst shouts at the shaved headed, skinny white guy to the right of the stage. She orders the blond “teacher twink” in UGG slippers, the black man who’s “doing it for Rosa Parks”, a “hairy bear”, and the “Auschwitz motherfucker” to take off their clothes. They’re vying for a chance to win free drinks for the night and Andrew Christian briefs by letting Mimi touch and inspect their junk. Mimi chooses the “teacher twink”, and when he comes back in only his slippers, glasses, and robin’s egg blue briefs, he struts down the very fitting cock-and-balls shaped runway and stage. That’s when the show really begins.</p></blockquote>
  <h2><a href="PDFs/NewPlace.pdf">New Place, Same Race: A Mixed American Reckons with her Ethnicity in Europe</a></h2>
  <blockquote><p>“Miss, we need you to step aside.”</p>
  <p>I had just gotten through immigration, landing back on Scottish soil after a weekend trip to Stockholm, Sweden. After four extra pat-downs, five failed attempts at reading Margaret Oliphant’s Hester, and a six-hour layover in Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, all I wanted to was get back to my flat in Edinburgh’s Southside and eat a curry. I was hoping to get out of the white lights of the immigration checkpoint and home before 10 pm. I wasn’t sure if that call was for me, so I kept walking.</p></blockquote>
  <h2><a href="PDFs/Lorde.pdf">Lorde</a></h2>
  <blockquote><p>On the tough skin of my belly, padded by fat and comfort and warmth, lie thousands of tiny white scars. Little pockmarks on my skin from years of inserting, removing, replacing, inserting, removing, replacing infusion sets and sensors and needle tips. Some are deeper than others, infusion set sites that were infected because they were left a little too long, too much insulin dosed at a time, not enough fat underneath to cushion the impact of the medicine being pushed into my body. These little scars, as invisible as they may be to the naked eye, are my gaper delay when I insert, remove, replace. I stop, take count of them for a second or too, before moving on. Insert, remove, replace.</p></blockquote>
