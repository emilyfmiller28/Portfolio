  <h2><a href="PDFs/Isang.pdf"><em>Isang Wika ay Hindi Sapat</em>: Filipino Literature and the Path to an Independent, "New Filipino" Identity</a></h2>
    <blockquote><p>How does one seek a resilient and revolutionary identity outside of colonialism when a unified identity did not exist prior to the imposition of colonial rule? Incorporating the cultures that oppressed them, and the use of language and education to reclaiming and celebrate the native tongue, allows for the creation of a “New Filipino.” Languages and education do not create the Filipino identity, but they are the common thread that allows the indios to create an identity on their own moving forward. Rizal’s work shows that Spanish rule and religion may be the unifier, but the subversion of its language allows for the unification of the Filipino on an independent level. Dogeaters recalls Rizal’s revolutionary sentiments on education and language, providing the global Filipino the space in which to identify as such regardless of location and context. These two texts together create a unique historiography written by Filipinos for Filipinos, allowing new generations of Filipinos around the world the space and context to create their own individual Filipino identities.</p></blockquote>
  <h2><a href="PDFs/Redefining.pdf">Redefining Remembrance: Transgender Narratives, Public Perception, and Janet Mock’s <em>Redefining Realness</em></a></h2>
  <blockquote><p>The retooling of the overarching trans narrative to be more expressive of each lived experience calls for a rhetorical analysis of these texts. Both the 2011 Marie Claire article “I Was Born A Boy” and Janet Mock’s 2014 memoir <em>Redefining Realness</em> creates a new rhetorical space in which trans narratives can be heard and understood as individual lived experiences by a wider audience outside of the LGBT community. In this conference paper, I will compare the rhetorical tools, structure, and format used in both of these narratives, focusing on what differences are created in our understanding of trans lives. I will then look at how these distinctions in understanding either fit into an overarching trans narrative or work to dismantle it. Lastly, I will contextualize these ideas of a trans narrative in greater media visibility and show what has and what hasn’t changed in light of these publications</p></blockquote>
  <h2><a href="PDFs/summerscholars.pdf">Fan Fiction Classification Through Additional Tags</a></h2>
  <blockquote><p>Using both Vladimir Propp's Morphology and the Aarne-Thompson Type-Index, I began correlating the various classifications of folklore to how fan fiction on the website Archive of Our Own were classified. I then created a classification system of 18 specific tag types that show what the authors value, what readers value, and what the authors think the readers value in the fan fictions posted.</p></blockquote>
