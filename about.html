  <p>Hi, I'm Emily!</p>
  <p>I'm a 21 year old, Philadelphian with a passion for Beyoncé, Basketball, and Belgian beer. I recently graduated from Saint Joseph's University with a Bachelors of Arts in English, with minors in Communications Studies and Gender Studies. In July, I'm moving to Chicago, IL to begin a year of service at Mercy Home for Boys and Girls as a MercyWorks Volunteer.</p>
  <p>I'm truly passionate about social justice and advocating for youth in crisis, women, LGBTQIA+, and incarcerated people. I spent my junior year studying abroad in Edinburgh, Scotland at the University of Edinburgh. I was the first Welfare and Accessibility Officer for the Feminist Society and a BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) rep for EUSA at the NUS Scotland Women's Conference 2014.</p>
  <p>At SJU, I was an active member of the Pep Band, playing Baritone Horn during Men's and Women's Basketball games, and a member of Sigma Tau Delta, the English Honors Society. I've participated in service learning, most recently in an Inside-Out Prison Exchange course called "Dimensions of Freedom," in which 15 SJU students and about 20 incarcerated students took a class together in a state prison.</p>
  <p>In my offtime, I enjoy writing code (I wrote this whole dang site!), reading divese books and articles, and watching far too much of <em>Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations</em>. I'm a huge fan of the Philadelphia Flyers, even if they didn't make the playoffs this year, and enjoy going to bars where they show playoff Hockey to the dismay of my friends. I also love cooking big meals for friends and family, especially if I can show off my Filipina heritage.<p>
  <p>Hi, Andy! Hope you can take a look at everything on the site and you like it well enough ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
