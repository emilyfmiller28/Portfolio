  <p>Hi, I'm Emily!</p>
  <p>I'm a 22 year old Philadelphian with a passion for Beyoncé, books, and beer. I graduated cum laude from Saint Joseph's University with a Bachelors of Arts in English, with minors in Communications Studies and Gender Studies. I moved to Chicago, IL this in July 2015 for a year of service at Mercy Home for Boys and Girls, serving as a MercyWorks Volunteer. As a MercyWorker, I am a youth care worker, providing direct care for young women ages 11-14.</p>
  <p>I'm truly passionate about social justice and advocating for youth in crisis, women, LGBTQIA+, and incarcerated people. I spent my junior year studying abroad in Edinburgh, Scotland at the University of Edinburgh. I was the first Welfare and Accessibility Officer for the Feminist Society and a BME (Black and Minority Ethnic) rep for EUSA at the NUS Scotland Women's Conference 2014.</p>
  <p>At SJU, I was an active member of the Pep Band, playing Baritone Horn during Men's and Women's Basketball games, and a member of Sigma Tau Delta, the English Honors Society. I've participated in service learning, most recently in an Inside-Out Prison Exchange course called "Dimensions of Freedom," in which 15 SJU students and about 20 incarcerated students took a class together in a state prison.</p>
  <p>In my offtime, I enjoy writing code (I wrote this whole dang site!), reading divese books and articles, and watching far too much of <em>Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations</em>. I'm a huge fan of listenint to public radio and podcasts on my commutes to work. I'm also a long-suffering Philadelphia Flyers fan, often feeling #blessed by Shayne Gostisbehere's amazing rookie season. I also love cooking big meals for friends and family, especially if I can show off my Filipina heritage.<p>
